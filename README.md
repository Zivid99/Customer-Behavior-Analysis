# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
Analyzing customer return patterns offers a strategic advantage, allowing companies to identify and address the underlying factors contributing to returns. 

# Project Overview：
# Background:
In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, understanding and mitigating product returns is critical for maintaining profitability and customer satisfaction. As businesses expand their online presence, the challenge of managing returns has grown exponentially. Therefore, analyzing customer return patterns offers a strategic advantage, allowing companies to identify and address the underlying factors contributing to returns. This not only improves the customer experience but also significantly reduces costs and resource wastage associated with the return process. 
This study employs SAS Enterprise Miner to further analyze customer return patterns, which is advantageous for data cleaning, refining predictive models and enhancing decision-making strategies in the realm of e-commerce. 

# Objectives：
1.	Design and build a decision tree model and ensemble method to predict customer behavior in SAS Enterprise Miner
2.	Interpret the branch basis and results of the decision tree and extract insights into customer behaviors.

# Dataset:
This study utilizes a comprehensive dataset titled "E-commerce Customer Behavior and Purchase Dataset," sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/e-commerce-customer-for-behavior-analysis). This synthetic dataset, generated using the Faker Python library, is designed to mirror the multifaceted nature of customer interactions and purchasing patterns in an e-commerce setting.
